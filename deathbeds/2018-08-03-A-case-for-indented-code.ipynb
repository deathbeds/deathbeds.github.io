    "# A Case for Indenting Code in the notebooks\n",

    "The notebook has [a few cell types](https://ipython.org/ipython-doc/3/notebook/nbformat.html#cell-types):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Markdown\n",
    "2. Code \n",
    "3. Raw\n",
    "\n",
    "Markdown cells and code cells are the most commonly used cell types in the notebook; raw cells less so.  Considering markdown and code cells only, an author has a binary choice to either __render__ or __execute__ code, respectively.  Another interpretation would ask \"is the code on or off?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "This discussion makes the case for using indented code cells as we commonly do at [deathbeds](https://github.com/deathbeds/deathbeds.github.io).  Indenting code cells can improve the interactive computing process while copy, pasting, and duplicaitng cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Also, indenting code cells is reminiscent of [literate coffeescript](http://www.coffeescriptlove.com/2013/02/literate-coffeescript.html) which `deathbeds` has always appreciated."
